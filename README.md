# Avalon
Targeted towards those who want to enjoy a game of Avalon without a deck of cards. Helps deal with 2 very important game mechanics. 

<h2>1. Distributing Roles </h2>
Unless one person is willing to bite the bullet, distributing roles without cards will be very difficult. This app lets you automatically select which roles are in play, and will randomly assign them as you pass the phone along. 

<h2>2. Voting </h2>
Voting is even more of a nightmare without pass/fail cards. Let the phone take care of it for you, collecting your total vote count and displaying it in the end.
